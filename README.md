# Hotel-Reservation-System

A simple Hotel Reservation System built in Java that allows users to browse available rooms, make reservations, and manage basic booking information. This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as object‑oriented design, data handling, and modular architecture.

## Features

1) Reservation – Users can browse available rooms and make a reservation directly through the system. The reservation process captures essential details such as room type, customer information, and booking dates, ensuring that each booking is properly recorded and tracked.

2) Check‑In – Administrators can check guests into the hotel upon arrival. This updates the reservation status, confirms room assignment, and ensures that the system accurately reflects which rooms are currently occupied.

3) Check‑Out – Administrators can check guests out at the end of their stay. This process finalizes the reservation, frees up the room for future bookings, and can be extended to include billing or summary details in future versions.

## Tech, Tools & Concepts Used

Java – Core implementation using object‑oriented programming principles such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and modular design.

Astah – Used to model the system architecture through UML diagrams, including class diagrams and workflow representations. This helped visualize relationships between components and ensured a clean, maintainable OOP structure.

Data Structures – Utilized to store and manage room details, reservations, and information.

Console-based Interaction – Simple text-based interface for user and administrator operations.
